## Is 'Beef' good?
Well, considering its only available through its own IDE at the moment, I guess?

Now, how fast it is in comparison to C++ and C# I don't know, and I can't be bothered testing either.

Practically, I just made this because I got bored, and you just wasted your time reading this `README`. Congratulations!
